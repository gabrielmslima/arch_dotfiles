# True Black Hyprland

this is my dotfiles for the arch linux and hyprland setup that i'm currently using on a regular basis.

i did not build this from the ground up, i used as a starting point the dotfiles from [stephan raabe](https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles) from [ml4w](https://www.youtube.com/@mylinuxforwork) channel hyrprland setup cus it gave arch linux good stability with all its updates and general arch maintenance scripts.

the setup currently follows a true dark theme with pitch black as its major color.
